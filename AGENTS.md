# AGENTS Instructions

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Workflow
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the user request.
- Prefer TypeScript and npm scripts already defined in `package.json`.
- Before finishing, run at least one project validation command (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`, or `npm test`) when dependencies are available.

## Documentation
- When behavior or usage changes, update the relevant docs under `docs/` and the root `README.md`.
- Keep examples copy-paste ready.

## Pull requests
- Use a concise PR title.
- In the PR body include: summary, files changed, and validation commands run.
